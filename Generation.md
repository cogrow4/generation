## 1. CORE CONCEPT

### High Concept
A 2D side-scrolling exploration game where you are the sole person awake on a generation ship, discovering the truth of your mission while racing to save thousands of hibernating passengers - or choosing to save yourself.

### Visual Perspective
**Side-Scrolling (2.5D perspective with depth)**

**Why Side-Scrolling:**
- **Cinematic atmosphere**: Side view creates more dramatic compositions and silhouettes
- **Easier depth perception**: Foreground/background separation is intuitive
- **Parallax scrolling**: Creates incredible sense of depth and scale with multiple background layers
- **Vertical exploration**: Can have multiple floors/levels visible, natural platforming
- **Character presence**: Character is more visible and expressive from side view
- **Lighting drama**: Side lighting creates more dramatic shadows and atmosphere
- **Simpler animation**: Only need left/right animations (mirror sprite)
- **Scale contrast**: Character small against massive backgrounds emphasizes isolation

**Camera:**
- Side-scrolling camera following player horizontally
- Smooth camera movement with slight lag (cinematic feel)
- Slight zoom adjustments in key areas (zoom out in massive hibernation bays)
- Camera can tilt slightly up/down when player looks (optional)

### Pillars
1. **Atmospheric Loneliness** - Empty halls, indifferent systems, complete isolation
2. **Lore-Heavy Discovery** - Piecing together the conspiracy through environmental storytelling
3. **Meaningful Choice** - A final decision with genuine emotional and moral weight
4. **Simple Mechanics** - Accessible gameplay focused on exploration and narrative

## 2. NARRATIVE

### Story Summary
You wake from hibernation malfunction aboard the GSS Exodus, a generation ship a century into its voyage. The ship is silent, thousands still in hibernation. As you explore to understand what happened, you discover three devastating truths:

1. The Exodus was a lie - Earth's governments used it to exile dissidents, undesirables, and troublemakers
2. A stellar radiation event forced emergency hibernation decades into the journey
3. The hibernation pods are failing after running far beyond their design lifespan

You discover you can redirect the ship to a newly-detected habitable planet - but saving everyone requires a manual override at the reactor core that will expose you to fatal radiation.

### The Three Truths (Discovered Through Gameplay)

**Truth One: The Conspiracy**
- Found in: Command Deck archives, classified terminals
- Earth was facing overpopulation and political unrest
- The Exodus "program" was sold as humanity's hope
- In reality: fake destination coordinates, pods designed to fail eventually
- Documents reveal bureaucratic evil: budget reports, efficiency memos, "humane solution" proposals
- The 10,000 people aboard never knew they were sentenced to death

**Truth Two: The Disaster**
- Found in: Engineering logs, automatic sensor data, crew emergency recordings
- 43 years into voyage: massive stellar flare detected
- Radiation levels would kill everyone within hours
- Emergency hibernation initiated - everyone under in 6 hours
- Timeline shows this was MONTHS ahead of planned hibernation schedule
- The pods were designed for 80 years maximum - you wake at year 107

**Truth Three: The Chance**
- Found in: Navigation systems, astronomical data, survey archives
- While exploring, you access updated stellar cartography
- A planet (designated PE-7742) is within range - actually habitable
- Previous surveys missed it due to orbital positioning
- You can redirect the ship, arrival possible in 35 years
- But you must also repair the hibernation system or everyone dies before arrival

### Character Background (Player Character)

**Name:** [Player can input name, default: "Passenger 7742"]

**Background (revealed through personal terminal access):**
- Age 27 when boarded (now technically 127, physically 27)
- Former civil engineer on Earth
- Charged with "conspiracy to disrupt social order" (protested housing demolitions)
- Volunteered for Exodus rather than imprisonment
- No family - they disowned you after your arrest
- Assigned to engineering team meant to wake during "arrival prep phase"

**Why You Woke:**
- Your pod's secondary cooling pump failed
- You were in Engineering Pod Bay 7, Section E
- These pods were manufactured by lowest bidder (discovered in documents)
- 23 other pods in your section show similar wear patterns

### World Lore

**Life Before Hibernation:**
- Ship operated normally for 43 years
- Multiple generations born aboard
- Functioning society: schools, markets, entertainment, governance
- People genuinely believed in the mission
- Culture developed around "the children who will see the new world"

**The Stellar Event:**
- Gamma ray burst from neutron star collision
- Detected 8 hours before impact
- Impossible to avoid at ship's speed
- Radiation would penetrate hull, lethal dose within hours
- Hibernation pods in deep storage offered only survival option
- Mass hibernation procedure took 5 hours 47 minutes

**Earth (Background Lore):**

## 4. THE FINAL CHOICE

### Reaching the Choice

**Location:** Reactor Core Chamber

**Requirements:**
- Gold Keycard obtained
- All ship sections explored (player understands full situation)
- Navigation system shows course to PE-7742 plotted
- Hibernation diagnostics show critical failure imminent

**The Setup:**
The Reactor Core Chamber is the heart of the ship. The fusion reactor powers everything. The hibernation system's emergency override is HERE because it requires massive power draw to safely restart all 10,000 pods simultaneously.

**The Problem:**
The override console is in the shielded control room. BUT the reactor's radiation shielding has degraded over 107 years. The stellar radiation event damaged it. To manually execute the restart sequence:

1. You must enter the reactor chamber (moderately radioactive)
2. Manually align the power couplings (high radiation exposure)
3. Return to console and execute restart sequence (takes 4 minutes)
4. Override safety lockout to push reactor to 140% capacity (required for all pods)
5. Monitor the sequence to completion (another 8 minutes)

**Total Time in Radiation:** 12+ minutes at lethal exposure levels

**Why It's Fatal:**
- Diagnostic terminal shows radiation at 847 rads/hour in chamber
- 400 rads is fatal without treatment
- You'll absorb ~170 rads just entering and aligning couplings
- Restart sequence requires constant monitoring - you must stay
- By completion you'll have absorbed 1,200+ rads
- Lethal dose. Acute radiation syndrome. Death in hours or days.

**Why It Can't Be Automated:**
- You discover this through engineering logs
- The couplings were designed for maintenance crew access
- Automation systems were damaged in the stellar event
- Remote operation was tried by the crew - didn't work
- Their logs: "Manual override only option. Requires presence in chamber."
- They couldn't do it - radiation would kill them before pods were ready
- They chose hibernation hoping future crew could fix it
- You're the future crew. There is no one else.

## 14. FINAL NOTES

### Core Pillars (Never Compromise)

1. **Atmosphere First** - Everything serves the lonely, desolate feeling
2. **Lore Density** - The world must feel deep and real through text
3. **Choice Weight** - The final decision must genuinely matter emotionally
4. **Simplicity** - Never add complexity that distracts from story

### Development Principles

**Keep It Focused:**
- If a feature doesn't serve atmosphere, lore, or choice - cut it
- No combat because it would distract
- No romance because there are no NPCs
- No crafting because it's not that kind of game

**Trust the Player:**
- Don't over-explain
- Let them piece together the conspiracy
- Respect their intelligence
- Let the choice be genuinely hard

**Respect the Theme:**
- Loneliness means ACTUAL loneliness - no AI companion
- Desolation means empty spaces, not "ruins with character"
- Indifference means systems don't care - no helpful AI messages

### Success Criteria

**The game succeeds if players:**
1. Feel genuinely alone throughout
2. Care about the hibernating passengers by the end
3. Struggle with the final choice
4. Want to discuss their decision with others
5. Remember the atmosphere weeks later

**The game fails if players:**
1. Rush through terminals without reading
2. Don't care about the passengers
3. Make the choice without hesitation
4. Forget the experience quickly
5. Focus on "completion" over experience
